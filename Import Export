Exporting and importing data from external files of different formats can be accomplished with SQL DML statements in MySQL. However, MySQL natively supports exporting to CSV but doesn't directly support exporting to XLSX or TXT. Importing data from CSV files is straightforward in MySQL. Here's an example of how to export data to CSV, import data from CSV, and create a sample XLSX file using Python and the `openpyxl` library:

-- Create a sample table and insert dummy data
CREATE TABLE sample_table (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    age INT
);

-- Insert some dummy data
INSERT INTO sample_table (name, age) VALUES
    ('Alice', 25),
    ('Bob', 30),
    ('Charlie', 22),
    ('David', 28);

-- Export data to CSV
SELECT *
INTO OUTFILE '/path/to/exported_data.csv'
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
FROM sample_table;

-- Import data from CSV
LOAD DATA INFILE '/path/to/imported_data.csv'
INTO TABLE sample_table
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n';

-- Create a sample XLSX file using Python with openpyxl
# Python code to create an XLSX file and write data to it
import openpyxl

# Create a new Excel workbook
workbook = openpyxl.Workbook()

# Create a new sheet
sheet = workbook.active

# Sample data
data = [
    ["ID", "Name", "Age"],
    [1, "Alice", 25],
    [2, "Bob", 30],
    [3, "Charlie", 22],
    [4, "David", 28]
]

# Write data to the sheet
for row in data:
    sheet.append(row)

# Save the workbook to an XLSX file
workbook.save('/path/to/exported_data.xlsx')
```

Please note that exporting to XLSX is not a native feature of MySQL, so you'll need to use an external tool or programming language like Python to create XLSX files. The code above demonstrates how to export to CSV, import from CSV, and create an XLSX file.

Make sure to replace `/path/to/exported_data.csv` and `/path/to/imported_data.csv` with the desired file paths, and `your_table` with the name of the table. For XLSX export, you would also need to install the `openpyxl` library in Python.

You can run the SQL statements in a MySQL client, and you can run the Python code in a Python environment with the `openpyxl` library installed.

To export and import data from external files in various formats (CSV, XLSX, TXT, etc.) using SQL DML statements, you can use database-specific commands. Below, I'll provide examples for exporting and importing data for a hypothetical "employees" table.

### Exporting Data to External Files:

1. **Export to CSV:**
```sql
-- Export the "employees" table to a CSV file
COPY employees TO '/path/to/employees.csv' WITH CSV HEADER;
```

2. **Export to XLSX (Microsoft Excel):**
You may need to use a tool or library to export to XLSX, as it's not a standard SQL feature. For example, you can use a PostgreSQL extension like `pg_excel` or use a programming language like Python with a library like `pandas`.

3. **Export to TXT:**
```sql
-- Export the "employees" table to a text file
COPY employees TO '/path/to/employees.txt';
```

### Importing Data from External Files:

1. **Import from CSV:**
```sql
-- Import data from a CSV file into the "employees" table
COPY employees FROM '/path/to/employees.csv' WITH CSV HEADER;
```

2. **Import from XLSX (Microsoft Excel):**
Importing data from XLSX files typically requires the use of a programming language like Python or a tool that supports XLSX file parsing.

3. **Import from TXT:**
```sql
-- Import data from a text file into the "employees" table
COPY employees FROM '/path/to/employees.txt';
```

Please note that the specific syntax and commands can vary based on your database management system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle). You should use the appropriate commands and tools supported by your DBMS. Additionally, you may need to grant necessary permissions to read/write files and specify the correct file paths and delimiters according to your requirements.
